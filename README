prevue_work.tar is the HDD image
Prevue.uae is the WinUAE config, the main thing to port over to another emulator is the HDD config
ESQ-3.asm is the source im using, the main changes is that i hardcoded everything from DF0 to DH2, i changed some var names regarding CTRL, added a custom subfunc for my bootleg InjectCTRL command (mapped to command =) and set the version info to Ver 10.0 Build 69 LOL
esq-ari-disassembly_sami_05-17.i64 is the IDA 9.1 database that ive been working with so far

Note: old scratch artifacts like `old/`, `old.zip`, and `src-vbcc.zip` were removed after cleanup.
