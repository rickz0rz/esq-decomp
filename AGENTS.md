# ESQ decompilation — working agreement

Reverse-engineering of ESQ, the Prevue Guide channel-listings program for the
Amiga. Abandoned software; the goal is a faithful, buildable reconstruction.

## The prime directive

**Every change must be proven byte-equivalent by a build. No exceptions.**

This project has been attempted several times before and failed each time. The
failure mode was always the same: chasing *behavioural* equivalence, which has
no objective pass/fail signal, so small unexplainable hacks accumulated until
the result no longer worked and nobody could say which change broke it.

There are two gates. Both must be green before any change is considered done:

```sh
./test-hash.sh      # monolithic vasm build == 6bd4760d…  (exact SHA-256)
./build-split.sh    # separately-assembled+linked build == reference content
```

If a change cannot be made to keep both green, **it does not go in.** Revert it
and pick a different approach. Do not "fix" a mismatch by hand-patching bytes,
inserting inline assembly, or special-casing the build. A red gate is
information, not an obstacle.

## What "binary equivalent" means here

`test-hash.sh` compares the whole file. `build-split.sh` compares *content*:
hunk count, sizes, memory flags, every byte, and the complete relocation set —
but not relocation table *encoding*. Encoding is a linker artifact with no
runtime meaning, and the genuine original ESQ used a different encoding than
vasm emits, so demanding an exact byte match on it would be matching an accident
of the rebuild rather than the program.

Be aware the reference hash is **not** the shipped ESQ. It is a vasm rebuild of
a lightly-forked disassembly (`DF0:`→`DH2:` paths, an added `InjectCTRL`
subfunction, changed version string). The true original is ~400 code bytes
larger. See `docs/reference-binary.md`.

## Toolchain

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| `vasmm68k_mot` | assembler; `-Fhunkexe` for the monolith, `-Fhunk` for objects |
| `vlink` | links the split build |
| SAS/C **6.51** under `vamos` | the *only* compiler for the C phase |

SAS/C 6.51 lives on the `sasc:` volume (`~/.vamosrc` already assigns
`sc:`/`include:`/`lib:`). Its own linker `slink` is at `sc:c/slink`.

**Do not use the GCC or vbcc cross-compilers for restoration work.** Neither can
reproduce SAS/C codegen byte-for-byte, and attempting it is what sank earlier
attempts. They are fine for scratch experiments, never for committed output.

## Layout

```
src/Prevue.asm     canonical module list and link order; also the monolithic build root
src/*.s            shared headers: lvo-offsets, hardware-addresses, structs, macros,
                   string-macros, text-formatting, exec-constants, data-offsets, data-lengths
src/modules/**.s   code, one source module per file
src/data/*.s       data section, one source module per file
tools/gen_units.py derives link units from Prevue.asm
tools/hunkcmp.py   content-equality comparator
build/units/       generated translation units (not checked in)
```

`src/Prevue.asm` stays authoritative: it declares what is in the program and in
what order. `gen_units.py` reads it to produce the units, so the two builds can
never silently disagree about content or ordering.

## Two constraints that will bite you

Both were discovered the hard way; both are enforced by `build-split.sh`.

**1. Objects are longword-sized.** Hunk objects store section sizes in
longwords, so an object whose content is 2 (mod 4) bytes gets padded, shifting
everything after it. `gen_units.py` therefore coalesces consecutive modules
until each unit lands on a 4-byte boundary — which is why 164 source modules
become 69 link units. Source files stay fine-grained; only the assembly grouping
is coarser. **You can still edit any module in isolation.**

**2. vasm rewrites branches based on what is visible.** A bare
`JSR sym` / `JMP sym` is silently encoded as `BSR.W`/`BRA.W` when `sym` is in the
same section and in range, but as a 6-byte absolute when it is external. Split
the file differently and the encoding changes underneath you. All 48 affected
sites are now written explicitly (`BSR.W foo`, not `JSR foo`).

*When adding or moving code, always write the branch width you mean.* If a unit
grows unexpectedly, this is almost certainly why — diff the vasm listings
(`-L file.lst`) of the two builds and compare per-source-line encoding sizes.

## Build variants

`includeCustomAriAssembly` at the top of `src/Prevue.asm` gates Ari's debug
instrumentation (a serial status dump). It guards one block in
`src/modules/groups/a/o/esqpars.s` and one in `src/data/wdisp.s`.

- `= 0` (default) — the shipping program. This is what `test-hash.sh` checks.
- `= 1` — adds 128 code bytes, 52 data bytes, 11 relocations. `test-hash.sh`
  will *not* match, and should not; `build-split.sh` still must pass, because it
  compares the split build against a monolith built with the same settings.

**Both settings must keep `build-split.sh` green.** Check the `= 1` path after
touching exports or module structure — it is easy to break without noticing,
since the default build says nothing about it.

## Constants that used to resolve by accident

Under one big assembly, any symbol could reference any other. With separate
assembly that is gone, so a few genuinely-constant values were hoisted into
headers:

- `src/exec-constants.s` — `MEMF_*`, previously stranded inside a code module.
- `src/data-offsets.s` — fixed offsets between DATA labels (e.g.
  `Offset_RastPort2_FromDisplayContextBase = 8`), previously written inline as
  label-difference expressions.
- `src/data-lengths.s` — string lengths consumed by code. Each is re-verified by
  an `assert` at its original site in `src/data`, so editing the data without
  updating the header **fails the build** instead of silently desyncing.

Never add a hardcoded constant without an `assert` tying it back to the thing it
describes.

## Driving SAS/C (read before your first compile)

```sh
tools/cmatch.sh <file.c> <FunctionLabel> [extra sc options]   # compile + diff vs reference
python3 tools/refbytes.py <FunctionLabel>                     # reference bytes from the original
python3 tools/objbytes.py <file.o>                            # bytes/xdefs/xrefs of a compiled object
```

Three invocation rules, each of which silently produces wrong conclusions if
broken:

1. **Options must come BEFORE the source filename.** `sc FOO=bar file.c`, never
   `sc file.c FOO=bar`. Options placed after the filename are accepted without
   complaint and have no effect — every compile looks identical and you will
   conclude, wrongly, that the flags do nothing.
2. **`NOSTKCHK` is mandatory.** By default `sc` emits a stack-check prologue
   (`CMPA.L (d16,A4),A7` / `BCS.W`, referencing `__XCOVF` and `___base`). The
   stock binary has none, so without this flag *every* function mismatches by 8
   leading bytes.
3. **Option names are not guessable.** They use embedded-capital abbreviations —
   `STacKCHecK` → `STKCHK`, `STacKEXTend` → `STKEXT`, `OPTimizerPEEPhole` →
   `OPTPEEP`, `SHORTINTegers` → `SHORTINT`. Extract the full list with
   `strings sc | grep -E '^[A-Z][A-Za-z]{3,24}$'`. Invalid options *are*
   rejected, so a silent no-op means rule 1, not a bad name.

Note `sc5` is the same 6.51 driver in v5-compatibility mode, not a second
compiler version.

## Swapping a function to C

```sh
./build-split.sh                                             # pure asm, byte-exact gate
C_REPLACEMENTS=src/c/replacements.txt ./build-split.sh       # with C replacements
```

`src/c/replacements.txt` maps a module path to a C file. `gen_units.py` drops
that module from the assembly units and links the compiled object **at exactly
the position the module occupied**, so link order and layout are preserved. The
default build ignores the manifest entirely, which is what keeps the byte-exact
gates meaningful.

Two things must line up or the link fails:

- **Symbol names.** `sc` emits `_foo` for `foo`; `NOUSCORE`/`NOUNDERSCORE` are
  accepted but inert. So assembly must refer to a C-restored function by its
  real SAS/C name — rename the label *and* its references to `_foo`. This is
  byte-neutral (labels do not affect encoding), so `test-hash.sh` stays green.
  Use a word-boundary match: `\bfoo\b` will not touch `SOME_JMPTBL_foo`, since
  `_` is a word character.
- **Section names.** `sc` emits into `text`/`data` by default, which vlink keeps
  as separate output sections from `S_0`/`S_1`. The program's 3072 explicit
  `(sym,PC)` operands then become cross-section 16-bit PC-relative relocations,
  which amigahunk executables cannot represent ("Unsupported relocation type
  R_PC"). Always compile with `CODENAME=S_0 DATANAME=S_1`.

## Extracting one function into its own module

Replacement is per-module, so a function inside a multi-function `.s` must be
split out first. `NEWGRID_GetGridModeIndex` is the worked example: the module
becomes three files (before / the function / after), `src/Prevue.asm` gains two
extra includes at the same position, and the hash is unchanged because content
and order are identical.

When splitting, **distribute the top-of-file `XDEF` block** so each part exports
only what it defines — an `XDEF` for a symbol that ended up in another file is
an error. Verify with `test-hash.sh` before going near C.

## Library code is not application code

`src/modules/submodules/unknown*.s` is largely SAS/C runtime library code, not
application code. Confirmed: every relocation-free routine there appears
verbatim in SAS/C 6.51's `sc.lib` — `STRING_AppendAtNull` (`strcat`),
`MATH_DivS32`, `MATH_Mulu32`, `STRING_CompareNoCase`, `STRING_CopyPadNul`,
`FORMAT_U32ToOctalString`. (Routines with A4-relative fixups cannot be compared
this way, since those are resolved at link time and absent from the reloc
table — the 5% verbatim-match figure is a floor, not a ceiling.)

**Do not hand-decompile these.** No C fed to `sc` reproduces them, because they
were built from SAS's own library sources. The faithful route is to link
`sc.lib`. Treat a stubborn mismatch in a `submodules/` function as a signal that
it is library code.

## The C phase

Replace assembly with C **one leaf subroutine at a time**, compiled by SAS/C
6.51, and accept the result only when the emitted bytes are identical to the
assembly it replaces. If a function cannot be made to match, **leave it in
assembly and move on** — a partial decompilation that builds correctly is worth
far more than a complete one that does not.

Never reach for inline assembly to close a gap. That is the exact move that
produced the "odd regressions that don't make sense" in every prior attempt.
